# What is it about?
The 1st part of this seminar was to analyze a memory snapshot of an infected windows machine.
We should look for abnormal porceeses, internet connections, open ports, and any other factor
that was not normal.   

The 2nd part of this seminar was dedicated to the blackbox analisis of an infected windows machine.
We could use any tool we wanted such as: Wireshark, autoruns, processor_executor, our own scripts, in order 
to detect:  
  **--> What the malware was doing**
  **--> With whom it was communicating**
  **--> Its means of persistence**  
  **--> How to possibly stop it**
  **--> Its defences against security engineers, if any**
  **--> Any other relevant information**
