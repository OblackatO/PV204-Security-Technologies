# What is it about?
The point of this assignment was to detect what some program required when
it was trying to get a license in order to function. It was necessary to reverse
engineer the program and analyze its CPU commands, and change its behavior 
so it does not require the license anymore in order to continue. 
We were also required to understand the verification algorithm of the program
and create a fake license for it.
