# WHat is it about?
We had to bruteforce a disk full encrypted with a weak password.
This was not the main part of the assignment. The point of the assignment 
was to analyze the cyphers and keys used to make its encryption. We used a
snapshot of the virtual machine running the encrypted disk. 
My observations and conclusions, as well as the scripts I used to accomplish 
this assignment can be found here.
